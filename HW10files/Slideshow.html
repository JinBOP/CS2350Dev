<h2>Scott Pilgrim</h2>
<p>Scott Pilgrim is the main and namesake character of the Scott Pilgrim comic series. He's a cheerful, laid-back, friendly, and nerdy American living in Toronto, Canada. Scott is fairly childish and naive on some matters, but is overall good natured. Scott is well-intentioned, supportive, and considerate of his romantic partners, but is sometimes prone to selfish behaviors, leading to the failing of his romantic relationships. Due to his sensitivity and pattern for sudden infatuation, he has cheated on more than one occasion due to his discomfort with needing to be the one to break things off. This does not stop him from taking action, however, as he has stood up for himself and for his friends to fight off offenders more than once both.</p>

<h2>Ramona Flowers</h2>
<p>Ramona Flowers is Scott's primary love interest throughout a majority of the comic series. She is a tough, independent, sarcastic, humorous free-spirit who costantly dyes her hair different vibrant colors throughout the story. She uses her tough and mysterious exterior to cover up her own insecurities, though, fearing commitment and having a tendancy to run from her past, carrying a lot of baggage with her from her previous relationships.</p>

<h2>Knives Chau</h2>
<p>Knives Chau is a Chinese-Canadian High Schooler and Scotts initial love interest at the beginning of the comic series. A self-proclaimed "Scott-a-holic", she is obsessed with Scott, as he's the only thing which truly made her happy in her otherwise boring life. She is quite cheerful and bubbly, excited to see Scott's band "Sex Bob-omb" whenever they play. However she doesn't take the news well and even goes out of her way to attack Ramona after Scott eventually dumps her, dating Sex Bob-omb's groupie Young Neil to get back at Scott and Ramona, which doesn't last long.</p>

<h2>Kim Pine</h2>
<p>Kim Pine is Scott's High School Ex and the Drummer of Sex Bob-omb. She's sarcastic, stand-offish, and hates humanity as a whole. Kim also seems to have an inferiority complex towards Scott's most recent Ex at the beginning of the story Envy Adams.</p>

<h2>Stephen Stills</h2>
<p>Stephen Stills is Scott's friend and bandmate, acting either nonchelant or incredibly serious depending on the status of the band and how it may effect his musical career. He appreciates his friends very much but doesn't put up with any BS from them, especially Scott.</p>

<h2>Wallace Wells</h2>
<p>Wallace Wells is Scott's gay roommate. He's easy going, calm, and has unreciprocated feelings for Scott. Wallace finds Scott annoying sometimes, but trusts and understands him deeply, allowing Scott to crash with him for nearly the whole comic series. He is incredibly good at establishing relationships and making friends, is a heavy drinker, favoring martinis.</p>
