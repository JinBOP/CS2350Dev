<h1>About The Heavy</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<img src="resources/Icon_heavy.jpg" alt="The Heavy icon" width="256" 
height="256">
<p>Mikhail, deemed The Heavy Weapons Guy of the mercenary team, 
    is a hulking man from the USSR who mows down enemies with relentless 
    firepower and incredible tankiness. He is the largest and most 
    dangerous of the mercs, being compared to a bear, but he is certainly 
    not stupid, having a PHD in Russian literature. Similarly to a bear 
    he is calm and quiet when not in a fight. His father was a 
    counter-revolutionary during the Russian revolution and thus he 
    spent several months in a siberian gulag as a young teen. He broke 
    his family out when the prison was burned to the ground and fled 
    with them, eventually finding a job in the United States as a mercenary.
    Heavy uses the money he makes as a mercenary to provide for his 3 
    younger sisters and mother back in Siberia, Russia.</p>

<h2>Work Relations</h2>
<p>The Heavy cares deeply for his miniguns, even naming each one, those 
    being "Sasha", "Svetlana", "Oksana", and "Sheila". He also shares 
    a deep connection with the Medic, trusting him enough to allow him 
    to do <a href="https://youtu.be/36lSzUMBJnc?si=TuVW3-bps16pJ7NY" 
    target="_blank" title="Go to Meet The Medic video">open heart surgery 
    and experimentation without a medical license during a raging battle
    </a>. Heavy doesn't care much for Scout but tolerates the other mercs 
    and his employers just fine.</p>
