    Distraction: Food Prep (heading level 2)
    I love eating healthy and often. This can lead to serious distraction. I 
    can be working away and think "I need to eat something." Then my mind 
    goes to work figuring out what to eat that is healthy, how to prep it, and 
    wondering if I have the stuff to make it. Then off to the kitchen I go to 
    fix it. After that there is the eating. Sometimes to save time I bring the 
    food back to my desk thinking I will work while I eat but really I get very 
    little done while I am eating. The whole process is pretty time-consuming. 
    And since it is healthy it seems like I am doing a "good" thing even though
    my work productivity is suffering.
    My most effective way to manage this distraction is to plan ahead. I can 
    plan the best times to stop and eat. That way I don't eat too often or forget 
    to eat (which can make me less effective even if I keep working.)Then I can 
    prep the food ahead of time before I start work. That way when it is time to 
    eat my break from work is much shorter.

    <h2>Distraction:Roommates</h2>
    <img src="resources/roommates.jpg" alt="two roommates talking near couch" width="1733" height="1155">
    <p>Since I live with my significant other, my mom, and my stepdad, trying to focus on things I'm working on can be tricky. Despite sharing a decently sized house, It can feel very cramped in spaces shared by the four of us, often needing to push past when trying to do dishes or cook. Relaxing can be difficult because of all the noise other people make too. Trying to get anything done when at least one other person is in the house can prove troublesome.</p>
    <p>In order to work around these hurdles, I try to schedule things so there's very little overelap. Cooking meals, taking care of chores, and using water all at different times to avoid fighting over resources. If needed I will wear headphones while working on my projects and schoolwork to drowned out background noise.</p>
